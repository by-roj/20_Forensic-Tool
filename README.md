Implementing digital forensicss tools and algorithms in Python

<br>

#### [1. Brute Force](https://github.com/by-roj/20_Forensics-Tool/tree/master/BruteForce)

- Substituting all possible values to unlock a particular password

<br>

#### [2. Substitution Cipher](https://github.com/by-roj/20_Forensics-Tool/tree/master/SubstitutionCipher)

- A method of encryption in which a plaintext character unit is replaced by another character unit according to a certain law

<br>

#### [3. Morse Code](https://github.com/by-roj/20_Forensics-Tool/tree/master/MorseCode)

-  A combination of short(ãƒ») and long(-) transmission currents appropriately, indicating alphabetic characters and numerals

<br>

#### [4. XOR Crypt](https://github.com/by-roj/20_Forensics-Tool/tree/master/XOR)

- Changing the contents of the text file to ASCII code, and XORing each byte with the value of the secret key
- Able to use same key in encryption and decryption because of bit restoration characteristics of XOR operation

<br>

#### [5. Complement](https://github.com/by-roj/20_Forensics-Tool/tree/master/Complement)

- One's Complement
  - A number with all values of one digit minus a given binary number
  - Bit value inverted
- Two's Complement
  - One's Complement plus one

<br>

#### [6. Port Scan](https://github.com/by-roj/20_Forensics-Tool/tree/master/PortScan)

- Searching for open TCP/UDP ports on a running server

<br>

#### [7.MBR Analysis & Recovery](https://github.com/by-roj/20_Forensics-Tool/tree/master/MBR%20Analysis%26Recovery)

- MBR Analysis Automation Tool
- Corrupted MBR Partition Recovery Automation Tool
